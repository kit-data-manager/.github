## Hi there 👋

We are **Data Exploitation Methods** (DEM), and this is our public software repository. Our group deals with research data management and metadata in particular. DEM is a group of the Steinbuch Centre for Computing (SCC), which is located at the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT).
