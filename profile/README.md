## Hi there 👋

We are **Data Explotation Methods**, and this is our public software repository. We deal with research data management and metadata in particular. We are a group of the Steinbuch Centre for Computing (SCC), which is located at the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT).

🌈 Contribution guidelines - how can the community get involved?
👩‍💻 Useful resources - where can the community find your docs? Is there anything else the community should know?
